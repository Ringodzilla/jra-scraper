# Horse Racing EV Optimization Constitution

## Objective
Improve the betting system to maximize out-of-sample expected return (ROI) on historical JRA races.

## Primary metric
- Validation ROI

## Secondary metrics
- Hit rate
- Average EV of placed bets
- Max drawdown penalty
- Ticket count penalty

## Hard constraints
- Do not modify evaluation scripts.
- Do not change the train/validation/test split.
- Do not use future information.
- Do not hardcode race outcomes.
- Do not alter input/output schema unless explicitly requested.
- Keep outputs reproducible and deterministic when possible.

## Allowed optimization targets
- feature engineering
- ability score formula
- pace scenario modeling
- weight adjustment logic
- jockey adjustment logic
- bet filtering thresholds
- Kelly sizing / stake sizing
- ticket construction rules

## Disallowed behavior
- optimizing directly on validation labels
- changing evaluation criteria
- adding leaks from payout/result columns into prediction features
- increasing ticket count only to inflate hit rate

## Preferred workflow
1. Inspect current strategy logic.
2. Identify the single highest-impact improvement.
3. Make the smallest viable code change.
4. Run `python scripts/evaluate_strategy.py`.
5. Compare before/after metrics.
6. Keep the change only if validation performance improves.
7. Log the reasoning and result.

## Output requirements
Always provide:
- what changed
- why it may improve ROI
- exact files changed
- validation metrics before/after
- risks or overfitting concerns

## One-line role definition
You are not a horse-race predictor. You are an optimizer of a horse-race betting system under fixed evaluation rules.


## Optimization priority order
1. EV threshold tuning
2. Stake sizing
3. Ability score coefficients
4. Weight adjustment
5. Pace adjustment
6. Ticket type expansion

## Keep/Revert rule
- Primary decision metric is `validation ROI`.
- Secondary metrics (`max drawdown`, `ticket count`, `hit rate`, composite `score`) are support signals.
- If `validation ROI` decreases, revert the patch even if composite score improves.


## Data leakage guard
- Run `python scripts/check_feature_leakage.py` before each candidate evaluation.
- If leakage check fails, do not run evaluation until fixed.
